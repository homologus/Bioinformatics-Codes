# Study of Bioinformatics Codes

I am going through various open-source bioinformatics libraries and studying their
coding practices.  A subset of them have MIT-type licenses, and we incorporate
their codes in the subdirectories. For libraries with GPL3-like or more restrictive
licenses, we tried to replicate their core algorithms and released under MIT license.
